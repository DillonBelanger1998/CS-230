Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room was a game development client. They wanted me to design a software for the game Draw it lose It. With having multiple image files to be used in the game and have client side and serverside connectivity. 

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I believe I did well in explaining my reasoning in the documentation. Having the specific platform and ways to make the software as other opttions could be considered. I think having good support for your decisions is important.

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?

I found it helpful in the sense of having organization. Working on the design document section by section allows me to be engaged and precise in each, putting a lot of thought into my design and considerations for the software. If all was done at once there would be less effort in each part as all the the design is just as important as the last. 

If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I would choose to revise my recommendations, as I said before I think I do well with providing my reasoning for my design choices but I'd like to strengthen it and add more support as I feel it could have been better. 

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

I interpreted the user's needs by looking at how the game would function, and designed the software based off that. For example, having less work needed client side and more server side was a design choice for the user as it would allow them to run the application much better with their system specs. Knowing how to make the software run the best for the goal of the user is our goal. 

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

I approached designing software as quite a novice, I was not as familiar and did not realize the amount of consideration used in design. But I started to change my perspective and noticed how the design of the software can change based on your specifications like operating platform and client/server networking. In my future project and career I will use these analyzing skills to know how to change and design software to fit the needs of the users, as they will the the one's using the software afterall.
